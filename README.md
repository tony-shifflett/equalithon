# Okionu 

## Purpose
Okionu is a postpartum concierge service which aims to connect families of color to postpartum specialists. By centering the needs of families of color, Okionu aims to make culturally relevant services more accessible by eliminating the sometimes difficult search for these providers. 

## Tools 
This prototype is built with React Native. Additonal functionality is provided by [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) and [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)

## Design 
The design for this prototype was done by Leslie Garcia and Jennifer Cazeres. The wireframes can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mN6XPA0g1rxCtmAcpPy0EN/Wireframes---Okionu?node-id=0%3A1)

## Prototype Constraints
Due to circumstances arising during the hackathon, our team didn't have time to develop a backend for this app. Instead, simple navigation between screens is being used to mock up the full functionality in order to showcase the design and our Founder/Mentor's vision of what the app could be with sufficient investment. 

## Build
As of 3/29/2022, the prototype does not have a live deployment.
